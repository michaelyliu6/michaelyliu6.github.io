**About the Knowledge Base**

*   The knowledge base gives Claude access to long term memory. It's basically just a Python dictionary, and it is rendered like this
*   ```html
    <section id="pokmeon">
    I like pikachu because its cute and I like
    how it electrecutes people
    </section>
    <section id="brock">
    Brock stinks and I kicked his ass back
    on step 3932
    </section>
    ```

**The Prompt**

*   Tool Definitions
*   System Prompt
*   Knowledge Base
*   Blurb about how Summaries work
*   Conversation History
    *   Tool Use
    *   Tool Result
    *   ...
    *   Tool Use
    *   Tool Result
    *   Tool Use
    *   Tool Result

**The Core Loop**

*   Compose Prompt + Call Model
*   Resolve Tools
*   Check for Summarization
*   Save State

**The Tools**

*   **`update_knowledge_base`**
    *   What: Add to, edit, or delete content in knowledge base
    *   How: Claude specifies an operation + content
    *   Tool Result: Acknowledgement
*   **`use_emulator`**
    *   What: Executes a series of button presses + optional pauses for time to pass
    *   How: Claude writes an array that looks like `['a', 'b', 'start', 'select']`
    *   Tool Result: Screenshot + Overlay

*   **`navigator`**
    *   What: Finds the path to selected coordinates on screen, and executes button presses to get there. Calls `use_emulator` for execution.
    *   How: Claude specifies coordinates in its current view, i.e. `(6, 21)`
    *   Tool Result:
        *   If Failed to Find: Return helpful error message
        *   If Success: Success Message + Result from `use_emulator`

**State from RAM (Screenshot + Overlay)**
*   `Rival: GARY`
*   `Money: $2351`
*   `Location: MT MOON B1F (5, 8)`
*   `Badges: BOULDER`
*   `Town Map: 0`
*   `Potions: 10`
*   `Pokeballs : 15`
*   `Escape Rope x1`
*   `Tm34 x1`
*   `Tm12 x1`
*   `Moon stone x1`
*   Display:

**Summarization / Managing Long Context**

*   Rollouts are way too long for the 200k context window, so we need some way to manage context. I've found progressive Summarization to work well
*   Once conversation history > max_turns, we trigger a summarization event
*   This has Claude write a summary of their recent progress / what happened in the last max_turns.
*   Then we clear the full conversation history and insert the summary as the first assistant message, and Claude resumes its journey
*   Finally, another LLM is called to inspect the first LLM's knowledge base and to provide feedback -- this helps ensure the agent does more frequent maintenance of its knowledge base
*   This overlay comes from reading the tiles on the screen and checking if they are walkable
*   This info is all parsed directly from the RAM of the game, Claude Code is very good at this task.
