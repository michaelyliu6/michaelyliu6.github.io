## Reinforcement Learning Implementations

<details>
<summary>Image Prompt</summary>
<i>An anime-style scene depicting a group of cute robot characters in a world made of classic Atari game elements. In the foreground, an excited robot with glowing eyes and animated facial expressions has just successfully navigated through a Pac-Man-style maze filled with colorful dots and ghosts. The robot stands triumphantly at the maze exit, surrounded by sparkling reward particles and a floating '10000 POINTS' text in retro pixelated font. Behind it, the conquered maze shows its successful path highlighted in glowing light. From the successful robot's core, streams of colorful data and code are flowing back to three other robot characters waiting at different Atari-inspired challenges: one facing a wall of Space Invaders aliens, another preparing to bounce a Breakout ball with a paddle, and a third positioned before a Pong game setup. Each watching robot has holographic displays showing the successful algorithm and strategy being shared. All robots have distinct anime designs with expressive digital eyes, sleek bodies with retro gaming color schemes (reds, blues, yellows), and cute proportions. The background features a pixelated landscape with more Atari game elements including Adventure dragons and Asteroids space rocks. The scene is rendered in vibrant anime style with clean lines, digital effects, and the characteristic glow of arcade screens illuminating the robots' metallic surfaces.</i> - Generated by Flux 1.1 Pro
