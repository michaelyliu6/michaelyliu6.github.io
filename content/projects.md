## Reinforcement Learning Implementations

<details>
<summary>Image Prompt</summary>
<i>An anime-style scene depicting a group of cute robot characters in a world made of classic Atari game elements. In the foreground, an excited robot with glowing eyes and animated facial expressions has just successfully navigated through a Pac-Man-style maze filled with colorful dots and ghosts. The robot stands triumphantly at the maze exit, surrounded by sparkling reward particles and a floating '10000 POINTS' text in retro pixelated font. Behind it, the conquered maze shows its successful path highlighted in glowing light. From the successful robot's core, streams of colorful data and code are flowing back to three other robot characters waiting at different Atari-inspired challenges: one facing a wall of Space Invaders aliens, another preparing to bounce a Breakout ball with a paddle, and a third positioned before a Pong game setup. Each watching robot has holographic displays showing the successful algorithm and strategy being shared. All robots have distinct anime designs with expressive digital eyes, sleek bodies with retro gaming color schemes (reds, blues, yellows), and cute proportions. The background features a pixelated landscape with more Atari game elements including Adventure dragons and Asteroids space rocks. The scene is rendered in vibrant anime style with clean lines, digital effects, and the characteristic glow of arcade screens illuminating the robots' metallic surfaces.</i> - Generated by Flux 1.1 Pro

## LLM Evaluation Framework

<details>
<summary>Image Prompt</summary>
<i>An anime-style scene showcasing a recursive AI evaluation laboratory. In the foreground, a scientist character with glasses and a digital tablet is orchestrating a multi-layered evaluation system. The central feature is a striking "evaluation inception" visualization - a series of nested, glowing rings representing LLMs evaluating other LLMs. Each ring contains AI entities analyzing the output of inner-ring AIs, with data flowing between layers. One AI character is generating test cases, passing them to a second AI that's producing responses, while a third AI is scoring those responses with complex metrics floating around it. A fourth AI is analyzing those scores and refining the evaluation criteria, creating a perfect loop. Holographic displays show this recursive process with labels like "Meta-Evaluation Layer 3" and "Alignment Verification Loop." In the background, several agent robots navigate a Wikipedia-themed maze, but now they're being observed by evaluator robots taking notes on clipboards. The laboratory features fractal-like screens showing the same evaluation patterns repeating at different scales. Digital metrics flow between systems in colorful streams, with some screens showing "Evaluator Bias Analysis" and "Meta-Alignment Testing." The entire scene has a recursive aesthetic with evaluation processes visibly nested within each other, all rendered in vibrant anime style with expressive AI characters showing varying degrees of concentration as they evaluate their peers.</i>

A comprehensive framework for evaluating Large Language Models through multiple methodologies. This project implements alignment testing procedures (recreating the "Faking Alignment" research), sophisticated dataset generation capabilities, and agent-based evaluation techniques including Wikipedia navigation challenges. Built with Python, integrates with major LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic), and leverages type-safe structures with Pydantic, demonstrating expertise in AI safety research and evaluation methodologies.
