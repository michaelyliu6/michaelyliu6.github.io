Hi there! I'm Michael Liu, a software engineer passionate about AI development and safety. I combine practical engineering experience with a deep interest in advancing AI technology in reliable and beneficial ways.

I'm currently seeking roles in AI development.

## Professional Background

I most recently served as a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon Web Services (AWS), where I was a key member of the Data transfer Metering team. Our system processed 140 PB of data and $11 million in revenue daily, serving as a critical component of AWS's infrastructure. During my tenure, I:
- Led cross-team initiatives for automating AWS region builds
- Implemented storage optimizations resulting in ~600PB/month savings
- Maintained 24/7 system reliability through on-call rotations and incident response
- Mentored new team members and interns

I hold a BS in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning from the University of Maryland, College Park.

<!-- ## Technical Interests -->

<!-- My current focus areas include:

- **AI Development**: Working on model capabilities, pre-training and post-training techniques, and AI applications
- **AI Safety & Interpretability**: Exploring areas such as induction heads, superposition, sparse autoencoders, and understanding neural networks beyond the black box approach
- **Software Engineering**: Building robust and scalable systems with a focus on reliability and performance -->

## Current Learning Focus

I'm currently deepening my expertise in:

- **Transformer Architecture & Model Capabilities**: Studying pre-training and post-training techniques to enhance model performance and reliability
- **Diffusion Models**: Implementing and experimenting with image generation architectures (e.g. DDPM/DDIM, )
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Building and training agent systems with a focus on practical applications
- **Model Interpretability**: Exploring techniques like sparse autoencoders, induction heads, and superposition to better understand model behavior
