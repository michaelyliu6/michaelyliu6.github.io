## What is this page?
This is my personal collection of AI learning resources that I've found valuable in my journey. While it primarily serves as my digital garden of knowledge links (which I keep permanently bookmarked for easy reference), I'm sharing it publicly for two important reasons:

1. To help me keep track of AI learning materials
2. To democratize access to AI knowledge

I've often met people who seemed impossibly knowledgeable, only to realize later that the gap wasn't about innate ability - it was about consistent, incremental learning over time. Their expertise wasn't built overnight, but through daily exploration, spaced repetition, and gradually connecting dots between different domains. This page aims to make my "iceberg" of knowledge visible and accessible to everyone, whether you prefer to dive deep into specific topics or build a wider understanding of the field.

Fair warning: some of these resources can be a dense collection of resources. Rather than providing a structured curriculum, think of this as a map of intellectual wormholes - each one potentially leading to vast new territories of knowledge. Some resources might seem overwhelming at first, but that's intentional - they're meant to be reference points you can return to as you grow. This is also not an exhaustive list, but should help point you in the right direction. Everyone has the own unique interests and should build their own information streams through Twitter/X follows, RSS feeds, etc. 

While I maintain this primarily for my own reference and keep it bookmarked for daily use, I hope it serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in diving deep into AI development. Consider this a living document that grows and evolves with the field. 

If there are any resources that you think deserve to be on this page (or don't), please reach out to me!
