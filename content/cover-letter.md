## Salutation
Dear Hiring Manager,

## Opening Paragraph
I am writing to express my interest in AI development engineering roles at Google. With a strong foundation in software engineering from my experience at Amazon Web Services (AWS) and a deep passion for AI demonstrated through my comprehensive self-directed projects in transformers, reinforcement learning, LLM evaluation, and diffusion models, I am eager to contribute to Google's mission of developing responsible and innovative AI technologies.

## Body Paragraph 1 - Technical Qualifications
My technical background spans both production software engineering and foundational AI development. At AWS, I served as a Software Development Engineer II on the Data Transfer Metering team, where I maintained a critical system processing 140 PB of data and $11 million in revenue daily. This experience honed my skills in building reliable, high-performance systems—skills directly transferable to ML engineering. Though my professional experience wasn't explicitly in ML production, the challenges I faced with AWS's legacy codebase—debugging complex systems, optimizing for hardware utilization, and ensuring reliability at scale—mirror many of the challenges in AI development. Additionally, I've built a strong foundation in AI through self-directed projects implementing transformer architectures, reinforcement learning algorithms (including RLHF), LLM evaluation frameworks, and diffusion models—all from scratch and with meticulous attention to understanding the underlying principles.

## Body Paragraph 2 - Why Google
I am particularly drawn to Google because of its position as an AI-first company with a demonstrated commitment to both advancing capabilities and ensuring responsible development. Google's innovations—from the transformer architecture that revolutionized NLP to the impressive capabilities of Gemini and the groundbreaking achievements of DeepMind with AlphaGo, MuZero, and AlphaFold—represent exactly the kind of cutting-edge work I aspire to contribute to. I'm especially aligned with Google's "Frontier Safety Framework" and the emphasis on developing AI that is both powerful and safe. The opportunity to work with Google's best-in-class hardware infrastructure, including TPUs specifically designed for AI workloads, would provide an ideal environment for me to apply my skills and continue growing as an AI engineer.

## Closing Paragraph
I am excited about the possibility of bringing my unique combination of production engineering experience, deep AI knowledge, and strong work ethic to Google. My background in high-performance distributed systems at AWS, coupled with my comprehensive understanding of modern AI architectures and techniques, positions me to contribute effectively to Google's AI development efforts. Colleagues have consistently noted my clear communication style, collaborative approach, and strong attention to detail—qualities that would enable me to integrate seamlessly with Google's teams. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and passion for responsible AI development align with Google's needs and vision. Thank you for considering my application.

## Complimentary Close
Sincerely,

Michael Liu
